# This is a comment. Comments are notes that programmers can add into their programs.
# The program asks the user to enter strings. In this case, those strings are the car brand and the country the brand is from
# The input function allows the user to enter those strings 

brand = input("Enter a car brand: ")
country = input("Enter the country where the car brand is from: ")

# The sentence is printed. The command \n creates a new line in a program

sentence = ("The car brand " + brand + " is from " + country)
print(sentence)

# The program asks the user to enter strings, like in the last source  code. 
# Those strings are, again, the car brand and the country the brand is from

brand = input("Enter a car brand: ")
country = input("Enter the country where the car brand is from: ")

# This time, an f-string was used to display the sentence.
